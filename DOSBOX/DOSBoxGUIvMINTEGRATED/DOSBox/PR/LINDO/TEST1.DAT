! A small staff scheduling model:
!
! Each employee works a 5 day day shift with two days off.
! A worker can be started any day of the week.  A worker earns
! $100 per week.
!
! X<day> = Number of  of employees we start on day <day>
! 
 MIN     100 XMON + 100 XTUE + 100 XWED + 100 XTHU + 100 XFRI
       + 100 XSAT + 100 XSUN
 SUBJECT TO

 SAT)         XTUE + XWED + XTHU + XFRI + XSAT        >=   12
 END
! Type "GO" to solve the model. The objective should be $2200.
