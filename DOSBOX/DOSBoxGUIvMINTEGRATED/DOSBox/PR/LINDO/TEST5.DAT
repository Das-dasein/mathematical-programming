!  We want to decide how to place 7 songs on a record album so as to
!  maximize the number of songs on the "short" side of the album.  The
!  short side must contain no more than half the total music time. The
!  times by song are:
!
!     SONG:    1   2   3   4   5   6   7
!     TIME:    2   5   2   2   7   2   2
!
!  Y<i> = 1 if song <i> is assigned to short side, else 1
!
 MAX    Y1 +   Y2 +   Y3 +   Y4 +   Y5 +   Y6 +   Y7
 SUBJECT TO
      2 Y1 + 5 Y2 + 2 Y3 + 2 Y4 + 7 Y5 + 2 Y6 + 2 Y7 <= 11
 END
!
!  The Y's must be 0/1:
INT 7
!
! Type "GO" to solve the model, and "SOLU" to get a solution report.
! Songs 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 should appear on the short side.
